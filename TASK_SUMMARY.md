# Task Summary

## Previous Task: Refactoring "Feature Query"

The previous task involved refactoring the "Feature Query" functionality in the application to be a collapsible section within the "Layers" panel, rather than a dialog.

The following modifications were successfully completed:

1.  **`src/pages/MapView.tsx`**: The `FeatureQuery` component and its associated dialog logic were removed.
2.  **`src/components/toolbar/GISToolbar.tsx`**: The "Feature Query" button and its `onFeatureQueryClick` prop were removed.
3.  **`src/components/toolbar/CollapsibleToolbar.tsx`**: The HTML structure and JavaScript logic for the "Feature Query" were integrated into the `ToolbarControl` class. It now appears as a new collapsible section below the existing layer controls, with dynamic population of layers and attributes, and functional query buttons.

## Current Task: Querying Supabase Data

The current task is to determine if the "building footprints" data, which is retrieved from Supabase, can be queried.

### Issues Encountered:

I have been attempting to query the `building_footprints` table using the Supabase MCP `execute_sql` tool. However, I repeatedly encountered the error: `relation "public.building_footprints" does not exist`.

- Initial attempts to query `building_footprints` directly and then `public.building_footprints` failed.
- Queries to `information_schema.tables` and `pg_catalog.pg_tables` to determine the correct schema also returned empty results for `building_footprints`.
- Even a very simple query (`SELECT id FROM public.building_footprints LIMIT 1;`) failed with the same error, despite the user providing the `CREATE TABLE` statement confirming the table's existence in the `public` schema.

### Current Status and Next Steps:

The persistent "relation does not exist" error, even after explicit schema confirmation and simple queries, indicates a deeper issue with how the Supabase MCP tool is authorized or configured to access the database. It's not a matter of SQL syntax or schema discovery from my end.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **User Action Required**: Please check your Supabase project settings to ensure the `building_footprints` table is accessible. Specifically, verify the following in your Supabase Dashboard:
    *   **API Key Permissions**: Confirm that the API key being used by the MCP tool (or the project's `anon` key) has `SELECT` permissions on the `public` schema and the `building_footprints` table.
    *   **Row Level Security (RLS)**: If RLS is enabled on the `building_footprints` table, ensure there is a policy that grants `SELECT` access to the role used by the MCP tool (e.g., `anon` or `authenticated`). A basic policy to allow all reads would be:
        ```sql
        CREATE POLICY "Allow all reads"
        ON public.building_footprints FOR SELECT
        USING (true);
        ```
    *   **Schema Visibility**: Confirm that the `public` schema is correctly exposed and accessible.

Once these checks are performed and any necessary adjustments are made, please let me know, and I will re-attempt the query.

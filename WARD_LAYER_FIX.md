# Mapbox Ward Layer Fix

## Current Status

The map currently displays only **Ward 2** correctly. All other wards (1, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are not rendering due to a misconfiguration in their `source-layer` names.

## The Problem

The application code in `src/components/toolbar/CollapsibleToolbar.tsx` attempts to load ward layers from a Mapbox tileset. However, the `source-layer` names generated by the code do not match the actual layer names in the tileset for most wards.

For example, the code generates names like `LU_WARD_1-90v1fw`, but the correct name in the tileset might be `LU_WARD-1-90v1fw` or something else entirely. This mismatch causes Mapbox to fail to find the layers, resulting in console errors and preventing the wards from being displayed.

### Why Ward 2 Works

Ward 2 is the only one that functions correctly because the `source-layer` name generated by the code (`LU_WARD2-90v1fw`) happens to be the correct one, matching the name in the Mapbox tileset. The other wards fail because their generated names are incorrect.

### Current (Incorrect) Source-Layer Names

Here is the list of `source-layer` names the application is currently trying to use:

-   **Ward 1:** `LU_WARD-90v1fw`
-   **Ward 2:** `LU_WARD2-90v1fw` *(This one is correct)*
-   **Ward 3:** `LU_WARD3-90v1fw`
-   **Ward 4:** `LU_WARD4-90v1fw`
-   **Ward 5:** `LU_WARD5-90v1fw`
-   **Ward 6:** `LU_WARD6-90v1fw`

## The Solution

To permanently fix this issue, the code must be updated with the **exact** `source-layer` names for each of the 6 wards.

### Required Action

1.  **Log in to Mapbox Studio.**
2.  Navigate to the **Tilesets** section.
3.  Find and click on the tileset with the URL `mapbox://heju05.3nf7d7kc`.
4.  In the tileset details, locate the list of layers and find the names for all 6 wards.
5.  Update the `sourceLayer` variable in `src/components/toolbar/CollapsibleToolbar.tsx` to use these exact names.

Once the correct names are applied, all wards will render correctly on the map.
